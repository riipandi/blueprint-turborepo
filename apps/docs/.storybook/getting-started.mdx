# UI Components Library

Welcome to our UI Components Library, a comprehensive collection of React components built with
modern web development best practices. This library combines the design principles of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
with the power of [tailwind-variants](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/), offering enhanced
type safety and a more streamlined development experience.

## Why This Library?

Our component library stands out by combining proven design patterns with modern development practices:

- **Type Safety**: Built with TypeScript and tailwind-variants for robust type checking
- **Accessibility**: Following WCAG 2.1 guidelines and best practices
- **Customization**: Flexible theming system with dark mode support
- **Performance**: Optimized for production with minimal bundle size
- **Developer Experience**: Intuitive APIs and comprehensive documentation

## Key Features

- üé® Modern styling with Tailwind CSS
- üîí Type-safe variants using tailwind-variants
- ‚ôøÔ∏è Accessible components with Radix UI primitives
- üåì Seamless dark mode integration
- üì± Responsive design patterns
- üöÄ Production-ready components

## Design Philosophy

Unlike traditional component libraries, we focus on:

1. **Maintainability**: Each component is self-contained with its own styles and types
2. **Flexibility**: Easy to customize without sacrificing consistency
3. **Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript integration for better developer experience
4. **Performance**: Optimized bundle size and runtime performance

## Key Differences from shadcn/ui

Our implementation differs in several ways:
- Uses tailwind-variants instead of cva for better type safety
- Simplified component structure
- Enhanced TypeScript integration
- More flexible variant system
- Built-in dark mode support
- Consistent styling patterns

## Theme Customization

Components support both light and dark themes through CSS variables. Colors, spacing, and other design tokens can be customized through Tailwind configuration.

## Best Practices

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Follow accessibility guidelines
- Maintain consistent styling
- Leverage TypeScript for type safety
- Use composition for complex UIs

## Contributing

Components are built with maintainability and reusability in mind. Contributions should follow the established patterns and include proper documentation.
